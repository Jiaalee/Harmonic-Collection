            Tasseography is an ancient kind of divination that involves the interpretation of patterns created at the
            bottom of a cup or saucer by tea leaves, coffee grounds, or other sediment. Practitioners would intuitively
            identify messages, omens, or insights about the future, events, or the querent&#39;s life by reading the
            shapes, symbols, or arrangements left by the residue. Tasseography is a distinctive tradition that gives
            seekers a glimpse into the unknown by producing seemingly random yet important patterns after drinking a cup
            of tea or coffee.

            Tasseography evolved as a divination tradition involving readings of patterns produced by tea leaves or
            coffee grounds, with roots in ancient China and spreading throughout the Middle East and Europe. During its
            peak during the Victorian era, it was a fashionable social practice in which residue in cups was examined
            for symbols said to hold insights into the future or the drinker&#39;s life.
