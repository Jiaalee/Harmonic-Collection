          Pendulum reading is divination using a suspended weighted object that swings or rotates to provide guidance or

        <p class="a-weighted-object">
          A weighted object, typically a crystal or metal pendant attached on a string or chain, is used in pendulum
          reading, a type of divination. To receive answers, practitioners hold the pendulum stable and ask yes or no
          questions, noting its movements (such as swinging, revolving, or oscillating). The direction or pattern of the
          pendulum&#39;s oscillation is understood as subconscious or spiritual energy guiding the seeker to answers,
          insights, or decision-making. This method is frequently utilized for simple yes or no questions, but some
          practitioners believe it can tap into intuition or higher direction for more difficult questions or energy
          work.
        </p>
        <p class="the-usage-of">
          The usage of pendulums in divination and spiritual rituals goes back centuries, with roots in many cultures.
          Pendulum divination was used in ancient China, where objects attached on threads were believed to communicate
          with spiritual energy. Similarly, pendulum-like devices were employed for dowsing and divination in ancient
          Egypt, particularly in identifying resources such as water. However, it wasn&#39;t until the 17th century that
          pendulums acquired popularity in Europe, thanks to Italian scientist and physicist Galileo Galilei&#39;s
          observation of their regular oscillations. Pendulums have been associated with discovering truths, accessing
          hidden knowledge, and seeking spiritual direction throughout history, growing into a tool for divination and
          intuitive investigation throughout cultures and time periods.
