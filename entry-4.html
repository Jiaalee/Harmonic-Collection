            Omikuji began as a tradition of drawing lots for fortunes in Shinto shrines in ancient Japan and evolved
            over ages. By the Edo era, it had evolved into the well-known tradition we know today. People go to shrines
            or temples, drawing random omikuji that offer forecasts and guidance on various elements of life. Favorable
            omikuji are maintained for good luck, and unfavorable omikuji are frequently left at the shrine,
            representing a desire to change fate. This longstanding tradition is still an important aspect of Japanese
            culture, providing direction and solace to people seeking answers to life&#39;s many questions.
